          <h3>James Bryce Flory</h3>

          <h4>1948 - 2023</h4>

          <p>James (Jim) Flory peacefully passed into the next life in the early afternoon of January 31, 2023, having left an indelible impression on so many. He lived a life filled with joy, compassion and a deep commitment to those he loved.</p>

          <p>Born in Spokane, WA, Jim was the youngest of two children of Earl and Rose Flory. He graduated from Southern Oregon College with a degree in Education.</p>

          <p>An accomplished photographer, his true passion was educating. For nearly 50 years, Jim combined his love of photography and education at Chemeketa Community College and Pacific University. He was always eager to share his knowledge and expertise, and his generosity extended far beyond his own family.</p>

          <p>An exuberant charm and infectious spirit drew people to him. Always the life of the party, quick to share a story or a laugh. His selfless nature, combined with his passion for life, inspired those around him to be their best selves.</p>

          <p>Jim's spirit will be seen always, and in all ways, by his beloved wife, Jean, his three children, Jeff, Bryce, and Elizabeth, his three grandchildren, and family, friends and innumerable former students, all of whom he cared deeply for.</p>

          <p>If Jim touched your spirit, please honor him by following one of his favorite quotes.</p>

          <quote>
            <b>Life is like a camera:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Focus on what's important.</li>
              <li>Capture the good times.</li>
              <li>Develop from the negatives.</li>
              <li>And if things don't work out … take another shot.</li>
            </ul>
          </quote>

          <p>A celebration of life will be held on February 25, 2023 at 1pm in the MPR on the lower level of Washburne University Center on the campus of Pacific University in Forest Grove, OR.
